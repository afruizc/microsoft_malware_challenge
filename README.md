## Description will eventually be here


## Splitting up the workload for feature generation



I made some zip files, one per each class, located in 

`/nfs/research/agonzales/git/microsoft_malware_challenge/data/train`

as 

`1.zip  2.zip  3.zip  4.zip  5.zip  6.zip  7.zip  8.zip  9.zip`


Each has varying size but could a good starting point. 

I added a directory for JSON data as well,

`/nfs/research/agonzales/git/microsoft_malware_challenge/data/train/json`

if you could put data back there as it comes out.
